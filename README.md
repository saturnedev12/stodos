Stodos is a small, lightweight, high-quality utility created in Dart, for creating a to-do list in a current project folder. I was inspired by devTodo. stodos can be very useful for a developer or a team to quickly list and view tasks to do in opening other large software. stodos is free software and I will be very happy to have another contributor.
